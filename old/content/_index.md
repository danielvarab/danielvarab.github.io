## About Me
Hi and welcome to my spot on the internet! I am a 3rd year industrial Ph.D. at Novo Nordisk and am part of the Natural Language Processing research group, [NLP North](https://nlpnorth.github.io/), at the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). I am honored to be supervised by [Christian Hardmeier](https://christianhardmeier.rax.ch). My research interests lie in the practical challenges of automatic text summarization, such as acquiring data, building multi-and cross-lingual systems, and balancing the synergies between extractive and abstractive system design. I have in the past spent much time building datasets and have as of late shifted my focus toward system design.
