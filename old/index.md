## About
I am an industrial PhD under the supervision of [Natalie Schluter](https://natschluter.github.io/). The project is funded by Innovationsfonden, Novo Nordisk Biopharm QC and I am a part of the [NLP North](https://nlpnorth.github.io) group at the IT University of Copenhagen. I find practical applications of NLP of interest, with a particular interest in controllable generation, low/no resource domains transfer, and good old programming.
