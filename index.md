<!-- I'm a NLP researcher and have spent most of my career on processing text. Most recently I've had a deep dive into summarization ([thesis](https://en.itu.dk/-/media/EN/Research/PhD-Programme/PhD-defences/2023/PhD-Thesis-Temporary-Version-Daniel-Varab-pdf.pdf)). Subjects that  of text generation with a particular interest in, in-context learning, retrieval based generation, controllable generation, and probing when LLMs retrieve information from memory rather than context. I recently received my Ph.D. from the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/) under the supervision of [Christian Hardmeier](https://christianhardmeier.rax.ch/). -->
